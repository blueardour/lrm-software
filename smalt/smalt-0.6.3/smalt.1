.SH NAME

.PP
SMALT
is a pairwise sequence alignment program for the 
efficient mapping of DNA sequencing reads onto genomic reference 
sequences. It uses a combination of short\-word hashing and dynamic 
programming. Most types of sequencing platforms are 
supported including paired\-end sequencing reads.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Running SMALT
involves two steps. First, an index of short 
words has to be built (smalt index). Then the sequencing reads are 
mapped onto the reference (smalt map). Sequence input files must be 
provided in FASTA or FASTQ file formats (ASCII text, see below). 
.PP
SMALT
uses a hash table of fixed\-length words sampled along the 
genomic reference sequence in the file \fIREFSEQ\-FILE\fP
at 
equidistant steps. The sequencing reads in the file \fIREAD\-FILE\fP
and, if paired\-end reads are mapped, \fIMATE\-FILE\fP
are then mapped 
against the genomic reference sequences one\-by\-one. The sequence files 
\fIREFSEQ\-FILE\fP,
\fIREAD\-FILE\fP
and \fIMATE\-FILE\fP
have to be in 
FASTA or FASTQ format. First, exactly matching seeds are identified in 
the reference sequences by looking up the k\-mer words of the read in 
the hash index. Based on these seeds, potentially matching sequence 
segments are selected for alignment by a Smith\-Waterman algorithm.
.br
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.SS INDEX\-OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-k \fP\fIwordlen\fP
 Sets the length of the hashed 
words. \fIwordlen\fP
is an integer with 2 < \fIwordlen\fP
<=20 (default: 13). 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-s \fP\fIskipstep\fP
 Sampling step size, i.e. the distance 
between successive words that are hashed along the genomic reference 
sequence. With the option \fB\-s\fP
1 every word is hashed, with 
\fB\-s\fP
2 every second word, with \fB\-s\fP
3 very third etc. By default 
\fIskipstep\fP
is set equal to \fIwordlen\fP\&.
.PP
.SS MAP\-OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
 When this flag is set, explicit alignments are output 
along with the mappings. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-c \fP\fImincover\fP
 Only consider mappings where the k\-mer 
word seeds cover the query read to  a minimum extent. If 
\fImincover\fP
is an integer or floating point value > 1.0, at 
least this many bases of the read must be covered by k\-mer word 
seeds. If \fImincover\fP
is a floating point value <= 1.0, 
it specifies the fraction of the query read length that must be 
covered by k\-mer word seeds. This option can be used only when the 
\&'\-x\&' flag is also set. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-d \fP\fIscorediff\fP
 Set a threshold of the Smith\-Waterman 
alignment score relative to the maximum score. This option affects 
the way alignments are reported in single\-read mode. For each read 
all alignments resulting in Smith\-Waterman scores within 
\fIscorediff\fP
of the maximum score are reported. Mappings with 
scores lower than this value are skipped. 
If \fIscordiff\fP
(an integer) 
is set to a value < 0, all alignments are reported with 
scores above the threshold set by the \fB\-m \fP\fIminscor\fP
option.
.brIf set to 0 (default) only mappings with the best score 
are reported. Reads with multiple best mappings are reported as 
unmapped. This is also how read pairs are reported irrespective of 
the value of \fIscorediff\fP\&.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-f \fP\fIformat\fP
 Specifies the output format. \fIformat\fP
can be one of the following strings: 
.RS
.TP
\fIcigar\fP
 (default) Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report
.br(see 
\fBhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/ssaha2\fP)

.br
(see \fBhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/spec.html\fP)
.TP
\fIsam\fP

.br
with hard clipped sequences. 
.TP

.RE
.TP
\fB\-g \fP\fIinsfil\fP
 Use the distribution of insert sizes stored in the file \fIinsfil\fP\&.
This file is in ASCII format and can be generated using the smalt sample
task. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-H \fP
 Print instructions on screen. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-i \fP\fIinsertmax\fP
 Maximum insert size for paired\-end reads. \fIinsertmax\fP
is 
a positive integer (default 500). 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-j \fP\fIinsertmin\fP
 Minimum insert size for paired\-end reads \fIinsertmax\fP
is 
a positive integer (default 0). 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-l \fP\fIpairtyp\fP
 Type of read pair library used. This 
specifies the expected relative orientation of mate\-pairs. \fIpairtyp\fP
can be either \fIpe\fP,
i.e. for the Illumina paired\-end library for 
short inserts (orientation: $-->$ $<--$),\fImp\fP
for the Illumina mate pair library (long inserts, $<--$ 
$-->$)or \fIpp\fP
when both mates are on the same strand 
($-->$$-->$)as in 454 read\-pair libraries. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-m \fP\fIminscor\fP
 Sets an absolute threshold of the 
Smith\-Waterman scores. Mappings with scores below that threshold 
will not be reported. \fIminscor\fP
is a positive integer (default 
\fIminscor\fP
= \fIwordlen\fP
+ \fIskipstep\fP
\- 1). 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-n \fP\fInthreads\fP
 Run SMALT
using multiple 
threads. \fInthread\fP
is the number of additional threads forked 
for mapping. The order of the reads is not preserved for the output 
unless the flag \fB\-O\fP
is specified. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-o \fP\fIoufilnam\fP
 Write mapping output (e.g. SAM lines) to 
a separate file named \fIoufilnam\fP\&.
If this option is not 
specified, mappings are written to standard output together with 
other messages. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-O\fP
 Output mappings the order of the reads in the input 
files when using multiple threads (option \fB\-n \fP\fInthreads\fP).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
 Report partial alignments if they are complementary on 
the query read (split or chimeric reads). A maximum of two partial 
alignments are output per read. The second alignment is labelled 
\&'P\&' (\&'\-f ssaha\&' or \&'\-f cigar\&' formats) or has the \&'scondary alignment\&' 
bit\-flag (0x100) of the SAM FLAG field raised (\&'\-f sam\&' or \&'\-f samsoft\&'). 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-q \fP\fIminbasq\fP
 Sets a base quality threshold 0 <= 
\fIminbasq\fP
<= 10 (default \fIminbasq\fP
= 0). k\-mer words of the 
read with base pairs that have a base quality below this threshold 
are not looked up in the hash index. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-r \fP\fIseed\fP
 If the there are multiple mappings with the 
same best alignment score report one one picked at random. This is 
relevant only in paired\-end mode or with the option \fB\-d \fP0
(the default). \fIseed\fP
is a positive integer used to to seed the 
pseudo\-random generator. With \fIseed\fP
= 0 a seed is derrived from 
the current calendar time. Without this option (default) reads with 
multiple best mappings are reported as unmapped. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-w\fP
 Output complexity weighted Smith\-Waterman scores. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
 This flag triggers a more exhaustive search for 
alignments at the cost of decreased speed. In paired\-end mode each 
mate is mapped independently. (By default the mate with fewer hits in 
the hash index is mapped first and the vicinity is searched for its 
mate.) 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-y \fP\fIminid\fP
 Filters output alignment by a threshold in 
the number of exactly matching nucleotides. \fIminid\fP
is a positive 
integer or a floating point number <= 1.0 specifying a fraction of the 
read length. 
.PP
.SS SAMPLE\-OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-m \fP\fIminscor\fP
 Sets an absolute threshold of the 
Smith\-Waterman scores. Mappings with scores below that threshold 
will not be used for the distribution of insert lengths. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-n \fP\fInthreads\fP
 Run SMALT
using multiple threads. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-o \fP\fIoufilnam\fP
 Write output to a separate file named 
\fIoufilnam\fP
rather than standard output. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-q \fP\fIminbasq\fP
 Sets a base quality threshold 0 <= 
\fIminbasq\fP
<= 10 (default \fIminbasq\fP
= 0). k\-mer words of the 
read with base pairs that have a base quality below this threshold 
are not looked up in the hash index. 
.PP
.TP
\fB\-u \fP\fInreads\fP
 Map only every \fInreads\fP\-th
read pair (default 100). 
.PP
.SH NOTE ON PAIRED\-END READS

.PP
The two mates of paired reads are expected in separate FASTQ input 
files. The mates of a pair are identified by the position in the 
respective FASTQ file. Read names are \fInot\fP
checked by the 
software. It is up to the user to make sure the mates of the i\-th read 
are the i\-th sequences in the FASTQ files. As a consequence 
paired and unpaired reads cannot be mixed in the input files.
.br
.PP
The \fB\-i\fP
and \fB\-j\fP
options specify the expected insert size 
range influence the way in which the mates are aligned. The mate with 
fewer hits in the hash index is mapped first and the vicinity 
defined by the expected range is searched for its mate. If the 
\fB\-x\fP
option is specified both mates are aligned independently.
.br
.PP
In some output formats the reads are labelled or flagged, 
e.g. as a \fIproper\fP
pair in the SAM format, with respect to the insert size 
range. But the alignments of all mates will be reported regardless of 
the range specfied with the \fB\-i\fP
and \fB\-j\fP
options. 
.PP
.SS DEFINITION OF \&'PROPER\&' PAIRS IN OUTPUT FORMATS
By default, the mates of a read pair are in \fIproper\fP
orientation when they 
map to opposite strands with the 5\&'\-ends on the outside of the double 
stranded segment spanned by the pair as expected from the Illumina 
paired\-end (PE) libraries with short insert lengths. A \fIproper\fP
pair has 
both mates mapped in \fIproper\fP
orientation within the expected 
insert range (specified with the \fB\-i\fP
and \fB\-j\fP
options).
.br
.PP
Paired reads from the Illumina mate\-pair (MP) libraries for long 
insert lenghts will have the 3\&' ends on the outside of the segment 
spanned by the pair. Signalling this to the progam \fIvia\fP
the 
\fB\-l\fP\fI mp\fP
option is important for correct labelling, 
e.g. of \&'proper\&' pairs, and also for assigning the correct mapping 
quality scores. 
.PP
.SS DEFININTION OF INSERT SIZE
.PP
The insert size of a read pair refers to the distance between the 5\&'\-ends of the 
mapped reads. This is in accordance with early SAM/BAM specifications but 
breaches SAM/BAM specifications from version 1.3 onwards.
.br
.PP
.SS EXTENSION OF THE CIGAR OUTPUT FORMAT
The CIGAR output format (option \fB\-f \fP\fIcigar\fP)
produced by 
smalt
comprises a label after the GIGAR tag (e.g. label 
A in GIGAR:A:51). The labels have the following meaning: 
.PP
.TP
A 
mates are in \fIproper\fP
orientation within the limits 
specified by the \fB\-i\fP
and \fB\-j\fP
options. 
.PP
.TP
B 
mates in \fIproper\fP
orientation outside the limits 
specified by the \fB\-i\fP
and \fB\-j\fP
options but on the same 
reference sequence (i.e. chromosome or contig). 
.PP
.TP
C 
mates are not in \fIproper\fP
orientations but on the 
same chromosome or contig. 
.PP
.TP
D 
mates are mapped to different chromosomes or contigs. 
.PP
.TP
N 
read could not be mapped. 
.PP
.TP
P 
Alignment is the second partial alignment of a split 
(chimaeric) read (only with \fB\-p\fP
flag). 
.PP
.TP
R 
Read is reported as \&'not mapped\&' because there were multiple 
possible mappings, but no random assignment was made. 
.PP
.TP
S 
Read was mapped as a single read (sole mapped read of 
a pair). 
.PP
.SH NOTE ON SMITH\-WATERMAN SCORES

SMALT
uses \&'standard\&' Smith\-Waterman scores:
.br
match: +1; mismatch: \-2; gap opening: \-4; gap extension: \-3.
.br
There is currently no way for the user to modify these settings.
.br
.PP
The options \fB\-d \fP\fIscordiff\fP
and \fB\-m \fP\fIminscor\fP
which 
determine how many alignments are reported, are based on Smith\-Waterman 
scores rather than e.g. edit distance. Calculating \fIscordiff\fP
from 
the edit distance is simple if SMALT
is run without the 
\fB\-w\fP
flag.
.br
.PP
.SH MEMORY REQUIREMENTS

.PP
The memory footprint of SMALT
is determined primarily by the 
total number N of base pairs of the genomic reference sequences and 
by the word length k (option \fB\-k \fP\fIk\fP)
and the sampling step 
s (option \fB\-s \fP\fIs\fP)
with which the hash index is 
generated. SMALT
requires approx. 4*(4^k+N/s) or 12*N/s 
(whichever number is smaller) bytes of memory for the index. The 
genomic reference sequences occupy about 2N/5 bytes during 
construction of the index and during mapping. 
.PP
For example constructing an index of words of length 13 sampled at 
every 6^{th} position (options \fB\-k\fP
13 \fB\-s\fP
6) for the human 
genome ($N = 3 x 10^9$) requires 4 GB. Mapping reads with this index 
requires 3.3 GB of memory. An index of the human genome built with 
options \fB\-k\fP
13 \fB\-s\fP
13 (default) requires 4.3 GB during 
construction and 2.3 GB during mapping. The recommended setting for 
100 bp Illumina reads, \fB\-k\fP
20 \fB\-s\fP
13, requires 4.0 GB 
for construction and 3.8 GB for mapping. 
.PP
.SH INDEX FILES

.PP
The command
.br
smalt index
[\fB\-k \fP\fIk\fP]
[\fB\-s \fP\fIs\fP]\fIINDEX\fP
\fIREFSEQ\-FILE\fP
.br
writes 2 files to disk: 
.PP
.TP
INDEX.sma
 Compressed set of reference sequences for 
which the hash table of k\-mer words was generated. 
N*2/5 bytes where N is the total number of base pairs of the genomic reference 
sequences. 
.PP
.TP
INDEX.smi
 The actual hash index. The file size is about 
min(4*(4^k+N/s), 12*N/s) bytes. 
.PP
.SH SEQUENCE FILE FORMATS

.PP
Sequence input files are expected in FASTA or FASTQ format (see
.br
\fBhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format\fP).
